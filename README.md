## About  

This is a boilerplate generator for [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) projects, based on a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) template.  To use it, you'll have to [install cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

It's true that `mix new` already generates project skeletons already, and actually `mix new project-name --sup` was the starting point for this project skeleton.  My template differs from that default in only a few ways (which I've written about [here](https://mattvonrocketstein.github.io/heredoc/elixir-boilerplate.html)) but maybe someone else will find this useful.

## Requirements

Install the `cookiecutter` command line:

    $ pip install cookiecutter`    

## Usage

To generate a new elixir project from my template you'll have to answer various questions about your project-name and so on.  To initiate that process, run the cookiecutter program on this repository

    $ cookiecutter gh:mattvonrocketstein/cookiecutter-elixir-project`
